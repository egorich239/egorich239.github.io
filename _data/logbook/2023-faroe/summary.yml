Remarks: |
  Imray Arctic and Northern Waters is useful as an overview, but lacks/underestimates depths around many ports, Navionics is adequate.
  There are a couple other sailing directions, that were given to me by the boat owner, these proved to be most useful.

  Tidal streams are very strong, they create races and choppy sea, in different places at different phase of the tide:
  - To estimate currents: install Rák app on you smartphone (www.rak.fo), 
    also <https://fishin.fo/> website has this information although it explicitly says "Not for navigation".
  - Races: There's local Almanac and/or Tidal atlas showing the rough sea areas, 
    as a function of delay after the recent Vestfallskyrrindi in Suduroy.
    The latter can be found online: <https://portal.fo/vestfallskyrrindi>
  - Watch out! Here's Erik Aanderaa having a near-miss south of Vagar island: <https://youtu.be/VNo3s10BH2s?si=U-xPBEiT_q_kvW8V>

  Fogs occur, sometimes thick. Watch out for the ferries, especially near harbor entrances.

  I haven't tried anchorage - most anchorages are exposed from at least one direction, and the depths grow fast.

  The harbors are mainly for fishing/locals, although Torshavn and Klaksvik have berths for visiting boats.
  The depths were enough for us everywhere, in Fuglafjord we had to stay at the very entrance.

  Shore power and fresh water: mostly available, sometimes with a prepaid plastic card of the corresponding municipality.
  I looked for "Havn" (or a similar) section of the municipality website when needed a phone of harbor master.

  Visit Mykines. Book well in advance, we were lucky to get four of the very few tickets left 3 weeks in advance.

  The bareboat charter is sparse, there are only a few private owners, chartering out in Torshavn.
