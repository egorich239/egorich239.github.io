    \sbull Optimized desktop-focused the Google Maps Transit (“get me from Zurich to Bern by public transport”) backends to  early smartphone clients with their lower bandwidth, higher latency, smaller screens. Contributed to API and algorithmic changes, resources estimates and provisioning, incidents investigations and stability fixes that would make the routing useful on desktop and mobile devices. Seamlessly replaced a redundant backend with an endpoint in a more generic service, coordinated the migration of downstream systems to the new endpoints. Implemented realtime GTFS data ingestion into the routing engine.\\
    \sbull Optimized the latency and resource consumption of a daily logs processing pipeline evaluating a Google Maps quality metric.\\
    \sbull Introduced query stream sharding in a YouTube personalization cache service, increasing the cache hit rate and cache memory utiltization.}
